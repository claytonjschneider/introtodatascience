Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.

    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly into Markdown then by all means, do your work on paper first and then typeset it later.  Remember that there is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",
    "- It is **bad form** to make your reader interpret numerical output from your code.  If a question asks you to compute some value from the data you should show your code output **AND** write a summary of the results in Markdown directly below your code. \n",
    "- 95 points of this assignment are in problems.  The remaining 5 are for neatness, style, and overall exposition of both code and text.\n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",

    "I think that it is most likely _some_ combination of all of these things, though I consider class warfare to be an especially debatable factor, considering our data does not lend itself to classism - but might be resolved by some other solution . In addition, I've read before that the \"women and children _first_\" calls were misconstrued as \"women and children _only_\", leading to an excess of male deaths, and apprently many unfilled lifeboats (Jack, really?). Based off of our data though, it does seem that age played a role and passengers between the age of 15 and 30 had increased chances of survival, while those in the age range of 30-40 had decreased chances, as well as children under the age of 15. Women obviously survived more across the board (as made clear in our data), possibly for the reason I have just listed. "

Whether or not you found evidence for these cases in the data, you might find it interesting to watch the movie (or just the segments of the sinking) to see one interpretation of these ideas. You can perhaps see how we might be persuaded to reinterpret the evidence of data by a heart-wrenching performance from a handsome young Leonardo DiCaprio!"
