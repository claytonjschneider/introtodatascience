    "This assignment is due on Canvas by **MIDNIGHT on Monday, February 8**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  Remember that you are encouraged to discuss the problems with your classmates, but **you must write all code and solutions on your own**.\n",

    "- Any relevant data sets should be available on Canvas. To make life easier on the graders if they need to run your code, do not change the relative path names here. Instead, move the files around on your computer.\n",
    "- If you're not familiar with typesetting math directly into Markdown then by all means, do your work on paper first and then typeset it later.  Here is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.  I also recommend the [wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) for LaTex.\n",
    "- Because you can technically evaluate notebook cells is a non-linear order, it's a good idea to do **Kernel $\\rightarrow$ Restart & Run All** as a check before submitting your solutions.  That way if we need to run your code you will know that it will work as expected. \n",

    "- 95 points of this assignment are in problems.  The remaining 5 are for neatness, style, and overall exposition of both code and text.\n",
    "- This probably goes without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work and justify your answers to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit. \n",

Even within this tragedy, thanks to the combinations of the records of the White Star Line and the thorough nature of follow-up research after the accident we have some records that can help us try to piece together the course of events on board the ship. Many of the historians and other researchers who have investigated this event have speculated as to what exactly happened.\n",

Be sure to use the `titanic_data.csv` data set, *not* the `clean_titanic_data` file or `dirty_titanic_data` file from the in-class notebook exercises."

    "I think that it is most likely _some_ combination of all of these things, though I consider class warfare to be an especially debatable factor, considering our data does not lend itself to classism - but might be resolved by some other solution . In addition, I've read before that the \"women and children _first_\" calls were misconstrued as \"women and children _only_\", leading to an excess of male deaths, and apprently many unfilled lifeboats (Jack, really?). Based off of our data though, it does seem that age played a role and passengers between the age of 15 and 30 had increased chances of survival, while those in the age range of 30-40 had decreased chances, as well as children under the age of 15. Women obviously survived more across the board (as made clear in our data), possibly for the reason I have just listed."
